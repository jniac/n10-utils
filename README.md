# n10-utils

Compilation of typescript utils, essentially for front-end concerns, essentially:
- React (observables, `useEffects(...)` (multiple effects declared once), etc.)
- ThreeJS (Vertigo Camera, `ShaderForge` (custom shaders), etc.)

Used as a submodule for now, could be turned to a NPM package.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/jniac/n10-utils.git src/n10-utils
```
